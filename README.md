# iffy RSS

iffy RSS is a web app that I created so I could aggregate all of my online
browsing into one place. The underlining way of gathering relevant information
is using RSS 2.0. The goal of this project is to have a semi-live test bed
where I can implement things to use new skills that I develop in my career as a
software engineer.
